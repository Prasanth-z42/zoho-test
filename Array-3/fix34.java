/**
 * Return an array that contains exactly the same numbers as the given array, but rearranged so that every 3 is immediately followed by a 4. Do not move the 3's, but every other number may move. The array contains the same number of 3's and 4's, every 3 has a number after it that is not a 3, and a 3 appears in the array before any 4.
 *
 * fix34([1, 3, 1, 4]) → [1, 3, 4, 1]
 * fix34([1, 3, 1, 4, 4, 3, 1]) → [1, 3, 4, 1, 1, 3, 4]
 * fix34([3, 2, 2, 4]) → [3, 4, 2, 2]
